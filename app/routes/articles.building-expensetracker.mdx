title: 'Building ExpenseTracker: from idea to full-stack app'
abstract: I set out to build a personal finance tool that fits my day-to-day needs, then grew it into a full-stack app with authentication, role-based admin features, expense/income tracking, meal planning, notes, and a clean React UI.

## Why I built it

I wanted a single place to track expenses, incomes, recurring bills, quick daily logs, and even weekly meal planning—all behind authentication and accessible across devices. Spreadsheets got unwieldy, so I built a proper web app.

## The first iteration

I started small:
- A basic Express server and a few REST endpoints
- A simple React UI with Vite for fast dev
- MongoDB models for expenses and incomes

Once I had create/read/update/delete working end-to-end, I layered on auth, summaries, and admin features.

## Tech choices

- Backend: Node.js + Express, JWT auth, Multer for uploads, Mongoose + MongoDB
- Frontend: React + Vite, Context for user/theme, custom hooks and UI components
- Styling/UX: lightweight CSS with reusable cards, modals, and tables
- Build/dev: Vite for speed, modular “service” layer for API calls

## Backend architecture

- Routes live under `backend/routes` and map to controllers in `backend/controllers`
- Data models in `backend/models` (e.g., `Expense`, `Income`, `FixedExpense`, `DailyLog`, `MealPlan`, `Note`, `User`)
- Auth pipeline:
  - `authMiddleware` validates JWTs
  - `roleMiddleware` gates admin-only routes
  - `uploadMiddleware` handles avatar/logo uploads to `backend/uploads`
- Highlights:
  - Dashboard endpoints aggregate totals by category and time period
  - Fixed expenses act as scheduled/recurring costs
  - A seeding script creates a Super Admin for first-time setup

## Frontend structure

- Pages in `frontend/expense-tracker/src/pages/Dashboard` for Expenses, Income, Meal Plans, Notes, Settings, and Admin
- Components compose the UI (cards, modals, summaries) with a shared `DashboardLayout`
- `UserContext` holds auth/session; `ThemeContext` supports dark mode
- API calls are centralized in `services` (e.g., `dashboardService`, `adminService`)
- Reusable UI patterns:
  - Add/edit modals wired to form inputs
  - Details modals for read-only inspection
  - Alert system for confirmation and feedback

## Authentication and roles

- Login/Signup pages exchange credentials for a JWT
- Token is stored client-side and attached via Axios instance
- Role-aware UI: Admin sees management screens; regular users see personal views
- Backend enforces roles at the route level

## Files and images

- Profile photos and logos upload with Multer to `backend/uploads`
- Filenames are timestamped to avoid collisions
- The client shows previews and validates file types

## Not all smooth sailing

1. Data modeling
   - Balancing normalized vs. pragmatic schemas for speed of iteration
   - Aggregation for summaries without over-optimizing prematurely

2. Auth edge cases
   - Token expiration and refresh UX
   - Ensuring admin-only routes are both hidden in the UI and protected in the API

3. Upload reliability
   - Handling large images, type checks, and clean error messages to users

## Looking back, and forward

This started as a personal tool and became a robust full-stack app. Next up:
- Budget goals and alerts when limits are reached
- Receipt OCR for quick expense entry
- PWA features for offline logging
- More charts and insights in the dashboard

## Update: Aug 2025

The dashboard now summarizes weekly progress and fixed expenses more cleanly. I also refined the theme system and added better admin tools for user management.
