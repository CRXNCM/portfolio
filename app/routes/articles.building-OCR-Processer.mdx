## Why I built it

I needed a robust OCR solution that could handle handwritten notes, printed documents, and everything in between. Commercial OCR tools were either too expensive, too limited, or too complex. I wanted something that could preprocess images for better accuracy, support multiple OCR engines, and provide a clean desktop interface for everyday use.
