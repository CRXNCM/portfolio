# Portfolio Setup Guide

## 🚀 Your Portfolio is Now Live!

Your portfolio has been successfully set up and deployed to GitHub! Here's what we've accomplished:

### ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. **GitHub Repository**: Your portfolio is now at `https://github.com/CRXNCM/portfolio`
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automated build and deployment workflow
3. **GitHub Pages**: Your site will be available at `https://crxncm.github.io/portfolio`
4. **Local Development**: Dev server running on port 7777

### 🌐 Access Your Portfolio

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/CRXNCM/portfolio

### 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Setup

#### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/CRXNCM/portfolio
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **gh-pages** branch
6. Click **Save**

#### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

1. In your repository, click **Actions** tab
2. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** to trigger the first deployment
4. Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

#### 3. Customize Your Portfolio

1. **Update Personal Information**:
   - Edit `app/data/projects.js` to add your own projects
   - Update `app/routes/home/route.jsx` for your personal info

3. **Customize Styling**:
   - Modify `app/global.module.css` for global styles
   - Update component-specific CSS files

### 🛠️ Local Development

Your portfolio is already running locally! Here's how to work with it:

```bash
# Start development server (already running on port 7777)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# View Storybook components
npm run dev:storybook
```

**Access your local portfolio**: http://localhost:7777

### 🚀 Deployment

Your portfolio automatically deploys when you push to the `main` branch:

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **GitHub Actions** will automatically build and deploy
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the changes to go live

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### If GitHub Pages doesn't work:
1. Check the **Actions** tab for build errors
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in **Settings > Pages**
3. Verify the `gh-pages` branch exists

#### If local development doesn't work:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Check if port 7777 is available
3. Look for error messages in the terminal

#### If build fails:
1. Check Node.js version (requires 19.9.0+)
2. Run `npm run build` locally to see errors
3. Check the GitHub Actions logs
